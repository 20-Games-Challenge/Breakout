# Breakout

## Game Summary
Breakout is a single player ballgame with a strategic twist on destroying bricks to create a pathway.

### Goal
The aim of the game is for the player to break all the bricks and advance to the level.

### Inspiration
Aside from the obvious inspiration, Breakout is based on the early game Pong, which is what Breakout inherited the paddle and ball from.
The mechanic of the ball hitting the paddle and walls are used as a foundation for the game's play, and will also be the most noticeable mechanic.

### Player Experience
The player is confined to a single screen with walls, a paddle and rows of blocks. The player will attempt to destroy all the bricks by hitting the ball with their paddle, all while trying not to miss the ball when it comes around.
